The MobilePush SDK can help satisfy unique use cases you may require for your application and product solution.

### Customizing Application Badge
By default, the MobilePush SDK will [automatically set the application badge]({{ site.baseurl }}/application-badging/application-badging.html) if Inbox messaging is enabled in your application. 

If you'd like to implement your own badging, follow the directions in the page above and use `setApplicationIconBadgeNumber()` based on your unique needs.


    // configure the SDK using the `"applicationcontrolsbadging":true` or `sfmc_setApplicationControlsBadging(true)` method

    // When your application needs to set the badge value (typically when going to the background), call the badge setter
    
    // Example: set the badge to the user's score
    UIApplication.shared.applicationIconBadgeNumber = user.score
