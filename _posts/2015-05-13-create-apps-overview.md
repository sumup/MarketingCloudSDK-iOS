To connect your iOS app to Marketing Cloud, create a MobilePush app in MobilePush within Marketing Cloud.

Each app in MobilePush represents an application connected to Marketing Cloud. The concept of connected apps in Marketing Cloud is similar to connected apps in Force.com. MobilePush apps represent apps built for the iOS or Android mobile platforms that use MobilePush to communicate with their users via push messages. Marketing Cloud classifies MobilePush apps as consumer-grade applications and utilize long-lived limited access tokens.

After you log into MobilePush, follow these steps to create a new MobilePush app:

1. Click **Add New App**.
1. Enter the name and description for the app.
1. Click **Choose file** and upload the icon for the MobilePush app.
1. To upload an APNS certificate, click **Change** and choose the certificate on your computer to upload. Enter the password for the certificate.
1. Make any applicable changes to the optional settings.
1. Click **Save**.

Review the steps in our [MobilePush documentation](https://help.marketingcloud.com/en/documentation/mobilepush/administering_your_mobilepush_account/add_provisioning_info_to_your_app_center_app/) for more information.
