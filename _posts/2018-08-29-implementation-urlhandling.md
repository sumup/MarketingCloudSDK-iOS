The SDK doesnâ€™t automatically present URLs from these sources.
* CloudPage URLs from push notifications
* OpenDirect URLs from push notifications
* CloudPage URLs from inbox messages using the built-in `UITableView` delegate

To handle URLs from these sources, follow these instructions.

1. Implement the `MarketingCloudSDKURLHandlingDelegate` protocol in your app.
1. Use the `sfmc_setURLHandlingDelegate:` method to set a delegate for this protocol.

> If you implement the `sfmc_handleURL:type:` protocol method and set `MarketingCloudSDKURLHandlingDelegate`, the SDK calls the `sfmc_setURLHandlingDelegate:` method. The SDK passes to your implementation of `sfmc_handleURL:type:` an NSURL value. This value contains the data of the push notification or inbox message, including the URL. A type value also reflects the source of the URL, either `SFMCURLTypeCloudPage` or `SFMCURLTypeOpenDirect`.

> See `MarketingCloudSDK+URLHandling.h` for more information.
